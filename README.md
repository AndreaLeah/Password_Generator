# Password-Generator

**Overview:**  
This is a password generator with a Tkinter user interface. Type in the website name, username/email, and click the add button. Clicking the add button saves all information in a csv file. A new password is automatically generated upon window startup, and after each press of the "add button". Pressing the search button searches the csv file and displays all instances that match the search item. If none are found, you are notified that no matches are found.
